# CantusProject-InProgress

Demos and in-progress sketches for the PLL's Cantus Music Visualization Project.

Sketches:
Live Input: good intro to live input; spectrum rectangles w/amplitude; background color changes.
FFTPitch: playing w/FFT.
HornSoundFFT_MRA: more playing w/FFT, spectrum, etc.
PitchColoredElipse: In progress; will hopefully change color/size depending on pitch  (currently mostly controlled by volume/doesn't work).
tintTest: image layering, powered by volume.
VolumeColoredEllipse: circle grows and changes color as input amplitude is louder or softer.
Frequency Attempts: links color and pitch!!!
Mixer Attempts: in progress; will attempt to use multiple inputs.
InputPitch: in progress; class to give pitch attribute to a live input.
